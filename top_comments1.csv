For mature companies, why pay for 2 juniors, when you can get a senior for 1.5 price, who might do the same work. In the previous years even C-level companies had internship-to-full-time pipelines, but now it looks more scarce.

Most companies that are hiring engineers often need teams of people to bake bread. Sometimes those teams are huge and often the bakers in those teams are responsible for granular (pun intended) steps to ensure the bread is the best bread it can be. So, if I want some good bread and I intend to have a team of 40 bakers with individual strengths and disparate responsibilities baking that bread, then soon enough the responsibilities will become so granular that actually, I do need at least one baker capable of drawing a valid orbital configuration.

My approach is that the interviewer is trying to find out what it would be like to have me as a colleague.

40992492,GarnetFloride,"It looks like we are in a hiring dark ages. Barely anyone can remember how to actually hire someone. 
Just this weekend I was talking to an electrical engineer who recently retired. He told his company that he wanted to retire FIFTEEN years ago. They never were able to find a replacement. 
Not that they didn&#x27;t try. They hired senior engineers but they couldn&#x27;t do the job. They hired grads right out of school but none of them knew calculus and didn&#x27;t want to learn. 
From my point of view, something happened during the Great Recession and its hasn&#x27;t recovered. At a couple of jobs I&#x27;ve seen those HR work anniversary emails and it&#x27;s always interesting to see the cliff that coincides with 2008. 
I want to believe in Hanlon&#x27;s razor, but I find it strains credulity that all companies are that stupid all at the same time. 
I also have a hard time believing that its sabotage, because that would be conspiracy theory zone which at this scale is unbelievable as well.
Yet companies are saying they can&#x27;t find anyone to hire. I am part of a job group with 25-30 people, most of which I would consider to be highly qualified. 
So I am thinking that something is going on that is causing companies to select against the very people they are trying to attract. 
But also it&#x27;s not a new problem. Just after WWII the economy was flooded with veterans and companies didn&#x27;t know what to do with them because military jargon is not corporate speak. Bernard Haldane came up with the Seven Stories Exercise to help veterans to figure out what they are good at, the transferable skills they have, and how to present that to companies in a way they can understand. 
We do know that 60% of postings are for ghost jobs that exist only to fool investors and&#x2F;or employees.

—<p>on: One year of using an Apple Watch Ultra as a phone ...<p>I have done this as well, but with series 4. Some notes:<p>- Apple Watch receives calls forwarded from your phone which creates a bunch of weird problems: 1) Imagine you’re at a bar and get a phone call. You need to either answer on your watch immediately on speakerphone which means its hard to hear the caller and hard for them to hear you, and your conversation is not private. Or, dismiss the call, go outside, put your airpods in, hope they connect, call back, hope they answer, and hope the traffic isnt too bad around you because airpods do not have best mics. 2) connecting airpods really suck, especially at home. You have to have your phone in the charger for it to forward calls to your watch, so when you put on your airpods, they will likely connect to your phone, so you run to your phone, then your airpods “magically” connect to your watch all the while your caller is shouting “hello” into the void. Not ideal for work calls.<p>- I really hated not having a notes.app<p>- messages are kinda bad, especially if you’re non-english. And again, if you’re out at a bar and meeting someone, you cant really wait to get home to message back, you have to noodle around on the small screen.<p>- Your friends will tease you. I didnt mind, but its good to be prepared.<p>- its a teeny bit annoying wearing a tech-watch. Can get a bit hot etc.<p>- You need an iphone to update the watch. This really suck because you never really feel you actually let go of your phone, its a hassle updating over bluetooth, installing apps etc. I would LOVE an ipad&#x2F;mac watch.app.<p>- You need Siri for many things, like maps.app, searching for certain things etc. It really sucks, like, completely unusable.<p>- doesnt work well switching from wifi to celluar. So many of the watches problems stems from connectitivty issues between wifi, bluetooth and celluar.
That said, i agree with every upside the OP mentioned. I will go back to watch+airpods again when it can work without an iPhone for calling and software updates. I think one new way to get around it is to setup watch with Family Setup. That way it can get calls without iPhone.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39982713#39988624"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39982713#39988624</a>",1721247638,40987402

Such ice was even used residentially, delivered every once in a while, and used in a refrigerator like &#x27;ice box&#x27;.  This ice would last the whole summer, it takes time for that much mass to melt, especially with some insulation.<p>Which is what underground glaciers have... they&#x27;re insulated.<p>Even a decade ago, we&#x27;d see -40C regularly here in Jan and Feb, which would counter 40C in the summer I suspect.<p>Anyhow, this could all be simple post-ice age land reformation.",1721286533,40976776

This is the key. There are three agents here:<p>* A &quot;verifier&quot; (a small model, whose job it is to discern correct answers from incorrect answers)<p>* A &quot;helpful prover&quot; (blue team, whose job it is to produce correct answers with an easy-to-follow explanation)<p>* A &quot;sneaky prover&quot; (red team, whose job it is to produce incorrect answers with a deceptive explanation)<p>By arranging these three models in an adversarial relationship with a <i>true reinforcement learning feedback loop</i>, the entire model grows and gets better.<p>This is fantastic to read, and corroborates the results achieved by SPAG -- easily one of my favorite papers from the past year.

40993483,vouaobrasil,"From the article:<p>&gt; As the figure shows, the wealthy individuals are considerably happier than the high earners in the income group.<p>Absolutely, 100%. Money has made me very happy. Once I saved up enough money from a high-paying job, I was able to quit and do whatever I liked. And I love every minute of it now. No 9-5, no wasting time doing things I don&#x27;t want to do.<p>The more money you have, the less you have to waste your precious finite time doing shit you don&#x27;t want to do. Money allows you to pursue your hobbies, travel, and just have time to appreciate life.<p>It does take less than people think. You just need enough to buy a cheap house in the middle of nowhere, an ability to give up some luxuries (big city life if you like that, new stuff all the time), and the intelligence to set up a few sources of relatively passive income and&#x2F;or set up a way to make a little money from hobbies in a surfer-like part-time fashion.",1721289617,40992644
40992901,derbOac,"Sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s the money per se, or what brings in the money, or both. My guess is the higher-paying jobs are more interesting and fulfilling; conversely if two people have equally stressful jobs, but one pays a lot and the other little, the high pay would mitigate against the stress (&quot;this has these costs but at least it pays well&quot;).<p>This sounds obvious maybe but it&#x27;s a bit different from money per se bringing happiness. It would be more about the perception of the work.<p>I also am not sure what to make of life satisfaction as a happiness indicator. It&#x27;s a single item reflecting one aspect of happiness; there&#x27;s other components of well-being. The author acknowledges this but it feels like a critical issue.",1721282823,40992644
40993261,kaskakokos,"In my opinion, this research is very biased: Looking at the first 5 questions [1] I see a materialistic context that channels the answer towards a materialistic view of happiness, where of course money is key.<p>Now, let&#x27;s take the Aristotelian definition of happiness: It is about doing good and matching one&#x27;s nature with one&#x27;s actions. Then I would design questions like:<p>- Do you feel that your life is interconnected with the lives of others?<p>- When you reflect, do you feel that your life is what it should be?<p>- Are you satisfied with your life?<p>- In your daily life you do things out of obligation that do not correspond to your true nature?<p>- etc.<p>It all depends on what definition of happiness you take, and the one selected by the sponsors of the work I guess is not mine.<p>[1]Source: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.trackyourhappiness.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.trackyourhappiness.org&#x2F;</a><p>- In most respects, my life is close to my ideal.<p>- The conditions of my life are excellent.<p>- I am satisfied with my life.<p>- So far I have achieved the important things I want in life.<p>- If I could live my life over again, I would change almost nothing.",1721287270,40992644
40993457,domatic1,"It&#x27;s very complex and depends on everyone&#x27;s life situation, I&#x27;ve had money issues in the past, I was stressed but at that time I had many friends and family close which made things ok. Now I am more successful and live abroad, but loneliness kills me, even though I have everything I dreamed of, I think back at the times I was &quot;poor&quot; and I was happier. I also tend to compare myself more with my successful friends and that makes me also a bit jealous. I don&#x27;t think money will make you happy because there is always someone who has more and there will be always be better things you can&#x27;t afford. Also we get used to everything fast, you will get used to your &quot;Ferraris&quot; at some point..

40993390,renegat0x0,"I remember my colleague from work who said that happiness is linear to amount of money. The more money the more you have vacations, houses, cars. Such view-point is very narrow and materialistic, but some people do think that way.<p>I remember comparing this to having toilets in work. You will be happy with having at least one in your office. It will be good to have two toilets and it will bring more happiness, but what about having 10 toilets? It will not linearly provide more happiness to the office.<p>It is good to have enough money to be able to live a convenient life. The rest is up to you. To your goals. To your motivations. Some people will never be satisfied just by having a big pile of cash only.<p>If you play a game with infinite ammo, infinite health it becomes boring quite easily.",1721288541,40992644
40993132,gmac,"I’m somewhat sceptical about this result, and the way it’s presented.

40992925,keiferski,"These studies never seem to address the &quot;keeping up with the Jones&quot; factor, or more broadly, that social opinions shape how much we care about money. I think a lot of people would be near &quot;maximum happy levels&quot; [1.] with very little money, but are indirectly socially pressured into needing more money in order to buy more stuff. A few centuries ago, it was normal for kids to have only a few toys, adults to have a few dozen books, at most, and this was typical. I don&#x27;t think kids then were less happy because they didn&#x27;t have modern consumer abundance.<p>Today, the social expectations on say, eating out at restaurants frequently, traveling for vacation, and so on are expensive, and to be a deliberately frugal person living in an urban area requires a lot of discipline and asocial behavior that wasn&#x27;t necessary before.<p>It would be interesting to do a study like this that selected people who care less about money, or at least cared less about the social expectations of money – and then see what an extra $500 or $5,000 would do.<p>1.
