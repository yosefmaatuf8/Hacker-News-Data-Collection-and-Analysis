40994244,martchat,"I think the IT job market is getting really dead as a great source of income. There were signs earlier of market saturation, but COVID somehow &quot;covered&quot; them to a certain degree. Of course there are multiple reasons for it, differing in every region:<p>Globally: IT development is in general moving away from outsourcing building custom solutions. You either build it in-house or subscribe to a ready SAAS product from 1000s available (many will go bust now - pick the winner in category). India is producing millions of offshore IT specialists every year. All above means that it really doesn&#x27;t make sense to hire as many IT jobs as before. 
This impacts US and EU for all jobs that can be done remotely (COVID-&gt; process was accelerated).The jobs that are safer from cheap outsourcing are the ones where you need to interact fluently with Product Owner (UX&#x2F;UI, frontend) or are requiring local knowledge, so are specific for the region (SAP consultant discussing accounting process with end-user).<p>Additionally other reasons by region:
US: rates raising, no cash for startups.
EU: manufacturing sector in Germany collapsed due to losing cheap energy source  (Russia). That translates into EU-wide slump in projects from that sector. New projects were put on-hold. 20% inflation has killed real wages growth and affected other sectors. 
Good sectors: finance is doing well. 
AI is fueling some startups (and killing customer service jobs in the process).<p>All in all, this new world will be interesting. Will the remote offshore jobs be affected by AI way more than local &quot;human-facing&quot; ones? Are we offshoring everything from production (China) to IT services (India)?

40993644,red_admiral,"&gt; A secondary goal of the “behavioral interview” is personality homogenization where companies want to enforce not hiring anybody “too different” from their current mean personality engram. Yet, the tech industry is historically full of weird divergent people doing great things for their own reasons (though, due to just basic population growth over the past 20 years, there are tens of millions more “normie computer people” now offsetting all the smaller pool of original “weird computer people”). When you start enforcing personality bubbles outside of what somebody can do, you’re just doing some sort of weird economic eugenics thing (make programming weird again!).<p>I think that&#x27;s only half the truth. Tech in the &quot;good old days&quot; heavily selected for a particular personality engram, and it still does today, but that engram has shifted.<p>There was a time when, as I&#x27;m told, turning up in a suit to a facebook interview was a big negative, and wearing exactly the right kind of gray t-shirt was a bonus.

Running a company requires making tradeoffs. Everyone always thinks their pet interest&#x2F;area is not getting enough attention. Of course the cloud architecture guy is foaming at the mouth to tell you your cloud architecture is terrible and needs to be fixed. I bet the marketing guys are foaming at the mouth to tell you your ad spend is suboptimal and also needs to be fixed this instant. But if the shitty architecture ran for 7 years, was it really that shitty? Am I supposed to be totally dumbfounded at someone copy and pasting a repo 12 times for 12 customers, as if that&#x27;s the most insane thing in the world. It sounds like it WORKED dude!

Or <i>anything</i>?<p>If you&#x27;re not actively doing that, then I would say you are implicitly accepting your status as &quot;a thing to be traded off against&quot; and should just shut the fuck up.

You can&#x27;t be upset that you&#x27;re only getting .5X (or .1X) resources. You can only use your judgement to execute, and predict&#x2F;communicate outcomes from that decision. If someone decides not to take your advice, that&#x27;s their prerogative, they&#x27;re in charge!

40992492,GarnetFloride,"It looks like we are in a hiring dark ages. Barely anyone can remember how to actually hire someone. 
Just this weekend I was talking to an electrical engineer who recently retired. He told his company that he wanted to retire FIFTEEN years ago. They never were able to find a replacement. 
Not that they didn&#x27;t try. They hired senior engineers but they couldn&#x27;t do the job. They hired grads right out of school but none of them knew calculus and didn&#x27;t want to learn. 
From my point of view, something happened during the Great Recession and its hasn&#x27;t recovered. At a couple of jobs I&#x27;ve seen those HR work anniversary emails and it&#x27;s always interesting to see the cliff that coincides with 2008. 
I want to believe in Hanlon&#x27;s razor, but I find it strains credulity that all companies are that stupid all at the same time. 
I also have a hard time believing that its sabotage, because that would be conspiracy theory zone which at this scale is unbelievable as well.
Yet companies are saying they can&#x27;t find anyone to hire. I am part of a job group with 25-30 people, most of which I would consider to be highly qualified. 
So I am thinking that something is going on that is causing companies to select against the very people they are trying to attract. 
But also it&#x27;s not a new problem. Just after WWII the economy was flooded with veterans and companies didn&#x27;t know what to do with them because military jargon is not corporate speak. Bernard Haldane came up with the Seven Stories Exercise to help veterans to figure out what they are good at, the transferable skills they have, and how to present that to companies in a way they can understand. 
We do know that 60% of postings are for ghost jobs that exist only to fool investors and&#x2F;or employees. 
We also know that HR writes job descriptions and does screening without any knowledge of what the job actually entails.
Obviously this is a failure in management, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect them because reasons even though they are losing money from not getting the work done. It&#x27;ll come to a head eventually but who knows when, probably not until after the US election.",2024-07-17 18:25:11,40986894

To even be interested in &quot;jobs&quot; is to be in a losers game. To be emotional, complaining and helpless about it as most here (who are not ignorant about this because they have not got to situation – lack of job – where deciding whether to leave or to apply again is REVELANT)<p>Two &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; You must adapt. It takes three seconds, SNAP, to change attitude; but those who do not adapt will be abused by employers. Hesistate and you will end up going back to hell you almost realized you want to leave.<p>Three &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; To inspire you, my own philosophy literally goes &quot;death before employement&quot;, meaning in the worst case one prepares to be homeless. There exists HUGE difference regarding this in that Middle East, Asia, Africa, few former Soviet States &amp; PARTS OF South Americe will be such that you are better off to spend money not in the cheap blanket, water bottle, backpack &amp; food but a ticket, perhaps used bicycle to another country + paperwork there (which tends to cost). At this point, attempting to do the airport thing may be safe. In most of Europe, homelessness is relatively safe. The point is: if you are not prepared to die before the principles, you will die yourself; see what has happended to these human&#x27;s souls.<p>Four &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; Then, what point does it make to leech off governments invididually, separatedly? I mean this: Were 100 in my position to chip in 300-500 euros (after inflation, this is not much; one months rent in many places; compare relatove to benefits of this idea), I could start a foundation here, for the normal wellbeing of these invididuals, purchase an used village school for 15K and invest 10K for making it livable (EG conducting proper examinations to prevent weather damage; establishing small pipe, carpentry, electronics &amp; brick&#x2F;concrete workshop to avoid hiring construction companies; water filtering &amp; collection; planting trees in the backyards; buying sleeping bags); then rent this for those of the group who can get the rent from the government wellfare and give this free for those who cannot, for use. This would result at best in wealth generation, if not from the rent, from next decade establishing small farm &#x2F; brewery and possibly having the foundation own few &quot;companies&quot; that are LARPs (CEOs and even few pointless meetings!) but do provide &quot;professional&quot; services to other companies, EG perhaps one company for IT, another for small construction gigs, third for food buffets &#x2F; event organization — depending on the skill-structure. Again, change in attitude (but of different type in this) is needeed, because over-emphasis (on real — but entirely manageable!) trust issues leads impoverishment.<p>Five &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; Most humans I know do not care about building wealth, IE assets. They will obtain a great house from their dead parents and not even think about renting it or the land but always want to SELL. TO become a formidable enemy, TO crush the establishment, one must have the will and the capacity for turning property into assets and assets into more assets (EG by using your highest market value lowest income assets for loan collatetal to invest into your high return business expansion.)",2024-07-17 18:25:11,40986894

40989956,MrJagil,"I really like this product, but I have been on this journey, and will repost a comment i made to a recent thread about replacing your phone with an apple watch.
—<p>on: One year of using an Apple Watch Ultra as a phone ...<p>I have done this as well, but with series 4. Some notes:<p>- Apple Watch receives calls forwarded from your phone which creates a bunch of weird problems: 1) Imagine you’re at a bar and get a phone call. You need to either answer on your watch immediately on speakerphone which means its hard to hear the caller and hard for them to hear you, and your conversation is not private. Or, dismiss the call, go outside, put your airpods in, hope they connect, call back, hope they answer, and hope the traffic isnt too bad around you because airpods do not have best mics. 2) connecting airpods really suck, especially at home. You have to have your phone in the charger for it to forward calls to your watch, so when you put on your airpods, they will likely connect to your phone, so you run to your phone, then your airpods “magically” connect to your watch all the while your caller is shouting “hello” into the void. Not ideal for work calls.<p>- I really hated not having a notes.app<p>- messages are kinda bad, especially if you’re non-english. And again, if you’re out at a bar and meeting someone, you cant really wait to get home to message back, you have to noodle around on the small screen.<p>- Your friends will tease you. I didnt mind, but its good to be prepared.<p>- its a teeny bit annoying wearing a tech-watch. Can get a bit hot etc.<p>- You need an iphone to update the watch. This really suck because you never really feel you actually let go of your phone, its a hassle updating over bluetooth, installing apps etc. I would LOVE an ipad&#x2F;mac watch.app.<p>- You need Siri for many things, like maps.app, searching for certain things etc. It really sucks, like, completely unusable.<p>- doesnt work well switching from wifi to celluar. So many of the watches problems stems from connectitivty issues between wifi, bluetooth and celluar.
That said, i agree with every upside the OP mentioned. I will go back to watch+airpods again when it can work without an iPhone for calling and software updates. I think one new way to get around it is to setup watch with Family Setup. That way it can get calls without iPhone.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39982713#39988624"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39982713#39988624</a>",2024-07-17 19:08:22,40987402
